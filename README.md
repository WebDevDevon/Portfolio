# Portfolio-2021

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript - Portfolio Site including links to my projects and ways to get in contact with me.

**Link to site:** https://devonthedev.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript

## Optimizations

Need to update the hovering thought bubbles so that they are viewable on all viewport sizes. When I get more time update/add more projects to the section. Add a real life professional head shot with a more in depth about me section.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned implementing a parallax background was more challenging than I thought, writing the javascript function and figuring out the exact Y-offset setting so that the image does not repeat on scroll was interesting.
