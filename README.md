# Portfolio-2021

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript - Portfolio Site including links to my projects and ways to get in contact with me.

**Link to site:** https://devonthedev.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript

## Optimizations

As it is now all you can view is just the english sets, If I had more time/In the future I hope to add the japanese sets along with all promo cards as well. Also implment some sort of api that updates recent sold listing prices of the card that was purchased on Ebay or TCG. When clicking on an image to open the fancybox model the release date text moves slightly to the right and reveerts when closed.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned sometimes loading of some pages are slow, I used the full size source image rather than compressing the preview image (something to go back an update).
